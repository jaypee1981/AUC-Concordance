# AUC & Concordance
Importance of Area under Curve and Concordant

Area under Curve (AUC) or Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is used to evaluate and compare the performance of binary classification model. It measures discrimination power of your predictive classification model. In simple words, it checks how well model is able to distinguish (separates) events and non-events. Suppose you are building a predictive model for bank to identify customers who are likely to buy credit card. In this case case, purchase of credit card is event (or desired outcome) and non-purchase of credit card is non-event.

Attached is the excel sheet to understand the calulation of Concordance & AUC
